This assignment involves implementing and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch for image classification on the FashionMNIST dataset. The project focuses on building and optimizing a CNN classifier for image recognition. GPU acceleration and efficient training techniques were implemented to enhance performance. Additionally, data augmentation and normalization were used to improve model generalization. The assignment also includes a comparison of different configurations to analyze model performance under stochastic and constant volatility conditions.
